Welcome Welcome!

Heres a run-down of what is contained in my Portfolio!

School Projects:
AstralCentipede.java - A partner school project where the assignment was to make a simple game that in some way uses 2d arrays with data stored in each of them

Passion Projects (Correlate with related content in my full portfolio):

Labyrinth.lua - This is code of a project I did to explore using procedural generation to create a labyrinth path over a 2d grid

RootMotion.lua - This is my module script for root motion, a concept that allows animation in Roblox to effect the player's movement, rather than keeping them in one place

Notable UIL Competition Practice solutions I've made (Each of these contain context inside of them + input/output examples):

Dante.java - Involves finding all prime numbers between A and B. I used a method of excluding all non-primes then counting the primes left

Melinas.java - Given amounts of change, find how many combinations of currency can represent that amount. This one was hard! My solution uses some tabulation I had to draw through

Pranav.java - A game simulator where I had to calculate the scores of both players if they play absolutely ideally. I used memoization which is always cool to use!

Ruth.java - A rain catching problem, where heights of walls are given, and the amount of water that can be filled into them must be returned. This was my first solution and it uses quadratic time.

RuthImproved.java - A return to Ruth.java where I took a little more time at the drawing board to find a faster way to do it.
